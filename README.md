# Mini SQL Database for Student Academic Records

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Mini SQL Database** designed to manage **student academic records** using **MySQL**.  
It demonstrates the use of relational database concepts such as table creation, constraints, relationships, and SQL queries.

The database stores information about students, courses, enrollments, and marks in a structured and normalized manner.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To design a relational database for academic record management
- To practice core SQL concepts using MySQL
- To implement relationships using primary and foreign keys
- To perform data retrieval using SELECT, JOIN, and GROUP BY queries

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Tool:** MySQL Workbench  
- **Language:** SQL  

---

## 🗂️ Database Schema

### Tables Included:
1. **Student** – Stores student personal details  
2. **Course** – Stores course information  
3. **Enrollment** – Links students with courses  
4. **Marks** – Stores marks and grades for students  

---

## 🔗 Relationships
- One student can enroll in multiple courses  
- One course can have multiple students  
- Each student-course combination can have marks assigned  

Foreign key constraints are used to maintain data integrity.

---

## 📊 SQL Concepts Covered
- CREATE DATABASE and CREATE TABLE
- PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY
- INSERT statements
- SELECT queries
- JOIN operations
- GROUP BY and aggregate functions
- Basic normalization principles

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Open **MySQL Workbench**
2. Create a new SQL file
3. Run the database and table creation queries
4. Insert sample data using INSERT statements
5. Execute SELECT, JOIN, and GROUP BY queries to view results

---

## ✅ Expected Output
- Properly structured relational tables
- Accurate academic records
- Successful data retrieval using SQL queries

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience with **MySQL database design and querying**.  
It serves as a strong foundation for understanding relational databases and SQL-based data management systems.
